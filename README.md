 Weather Classification using CNN and histogram equalizaton(CLAHE)

This project classifies weather conditions from images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
It includes image preprocessing, model training, and a simple GUI for prediction.

 Weather Classes
- Dew
- Fog/Smog
- Frost
- Glaze
- Hail
- Lightning
- Rain
- Rainbow
- Rime
- Sandstorm
- Snow

 Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Tkinter

 How It Works
- Images are resized and enhanced using CLAHE
- A CNN model is trained for multiclass classification
- Users can upload an image through a GUI
- The model predicts the weather condition

 How to Run
1. Place the dataset in the correct directory
2. Run the Python script
3. Upload an image using the GUI to get prediction

 Output
- Predicted weather label
- Original and enhanced image visualization
- Histogram comparison
